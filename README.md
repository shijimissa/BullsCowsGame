# Bulls and Cows

This program generates a random __four-digi number__, and the player has to guess it, receiving feedback in terms of __"bulls"__ (correct digits in the correct positions) and __"cows"__ (correct digits in the wrong positions).  
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
